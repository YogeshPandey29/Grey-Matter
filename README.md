# Grey-Matter
A blogging website created using Flask, and coordinated it's functionality through CRUD operations using a database via. SQLAlchemy.

Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is basically based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

WHAT IS WSGI?

Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.

WERKZEUG is a WSGI for Flask. It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.

...AND WHAT ABOUT Jinja2?

Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.

Flask is often referred to as a micro framework. It aims to keep the core of an application simple yet extensible. Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such functionality to the applications.
